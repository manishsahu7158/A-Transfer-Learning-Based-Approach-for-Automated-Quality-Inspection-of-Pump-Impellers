# A-Transfer-Learning-Based-Approach-for-Automated-Quality-Inspection-of-Pump-Impellers
The present work looks into a method for casting quality classification with a new and adaptable neural network classification framework. The analysis comprises building models based on CNN pre-trained models such as VGG16, ResNet50V2, InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 and a CNN model with a transfer learning approach, representing the dataset's probability distribution. In this work, binary classification is used for training models and achieves an accuracy of 94.31%, 90.23%, 90.23%, 83.00% and 82.77% respectively. Furthermore, this study recommends emphasizing recall over precision in the case of defective products incorrectly labelled as an ok products. And it also recommends emphasizing the F1 score over precision and recall if a good product is incorrectly labelled as defective. Furthermore, this research examined the robustness of the model and concluded that the VGG16 architectures should be implemented to classify the casting quality.
